# Neural Networks and Multi-class Classification

This week of lectures went over forward propogatation and how neural nets can be used to classify over multiple classes. The code in Octave was again very simple due to the vectorized nature. The modified files were

* lrCostFunction.m (same as in week 2)
* oneVsAll.m
* predictOneVsAll.m
* predict.m
