# Logistic Regression, Regularization

I aimed to vectorize as much as possible to have concise code, especially with the calculation of the gradient (noticing that the first term of the sum expression is just matrix multiplication). The modified files were

* plotData.m - Function to plot 2D classification data
* sigmoid.m - Sigmoid Function
* costFunction.m - Logistic Regression Cost Function
* predict.m - Logistic Regression Prediction Function
* costFunctionReg.m - Regularized Logistic Regression Cost
