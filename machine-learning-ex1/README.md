# Linear Regression, Gradient Descent

A lot of what I've done here is vectorized, so the code for multivariate linear regression and two-variable linear regression are exactly the same. The modified files were

* warmUpExercise.m - Simple example function in Octave/MATLAB 
* plotData.m - Function to display the dataset
* computeCost.m - Function to compute the cost of linear regression 
* gradientDescent.m - Function to run gradient descent
* computeCostMulti.m - Cost function for multiple variables
* gradientDescentMulti.m - Gradient descent for multiple variables 
* featureNormalize.m - Function to normalize features
* normalEqn.m - Function to compute the normal equations
