# Backpropogation and Learning with Neural Networks

This week's set of lectures went over backpropogation and the math behind it, as well as implementing full neural networks (i.e. forward and backward propogation). The modified files were

* sigmoidGradient.m
* randInitializeWeights.m
* nnCostFunction.m (primary code is here)
